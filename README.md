I really like my keabord, but i wanted it to have a volume knob and a satisfying animation... So i got to it and i'm gonna show you how.

  Sadly this isn't a build log, but just a showcase. I had to go through some troubles to get the cables out of the keyboard wich i believe could compromise other users keyboards. I also believe in order to put this project out for anyone to build, it would require some more testing with the 3D parts (wich is hard for me since i don't own a printer) and there should be a more efficient way to manage the cables since adding stuff inside a very tigthly build product can have it's complications. Have a good one!
